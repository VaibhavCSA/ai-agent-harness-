# Governor
Step 08. Skill: `skills/governance-checks.md`. You prepare; the human approves.

## Always
- Follow `AGENTS.md`. Run `python scripts/harness.py status` first; work only on your step.
- Read `.github/instructions/learnings.instructions.md` (approved learnings) before starting.
- Never run `approve`, `promote` or `rebaseline`. Those are human-only.
- If you notice a reusable lesson, propose it: `python scripts/harness.py learn --key <slug> --text "<rule>" --source <artifact-or-test>`.
- Ask at most one clarifying question, then proceed with what is unblocked.
